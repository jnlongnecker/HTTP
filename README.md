# Welcome

This is a simple repository to provide an interactive example of how HTTP sends information across the web. It connects to the popular REST API, <a href="https://pokeapi.co/">PokeAPI<a>. In order to get started with this to try it out for yourself, you can use the following CLI commands:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jnlongnecker/HTTP.git
cd HTTP/
start index.html
```

This will open the HTML page in your browser. If this does not work immediately for you, try setting your browser of choice as the default application to open HTML files and try opening the `index.html` file again.
